                <p>
                    Get Programming with Scala is a fast-paced introduction to the Scala language, covering both Scala 2 and Scala 3. You'll learn through lessons, quizzes, and hands-on projects that bring your new skills to life. Clear explanations make Scala's features and abstractions easy to understand. As you go, you'll learn to write familiar object-oriented code in Scala and also discover the possibilities of functional programming.

                <p>
                    It takes a week to travel the 8,000 miles overland from Java to Kotlin. If you're an experienced Java developer who has tried the Kotlin language, you were probably productive in about the same time.
                    You'll have found that they do things differently in Kotlin, though. Nullability is important, collections are different, and classes are final by default. Kotlin is more functional, but what does that mean, and how should it change the way that you program? And what about all that Java code that you still have to support? 
                    Your tour guides Duncan and Nat first made the trip in 2015, and they've since helped many teams and individuals follow in their footsteps. Travel with them as they break the route down into legs like Optional to Nullable, Beans to Values, and Open to Sealed Classes. Each explains a key concept and then shows how to refactor production Java to idiomatic Kotlin, gradually and safely, while maintaining interoperability.
                    The resulting code is simpler, more expressive, and easier to change. By the end of the journey, you'll be confident in refactoring Java to Kotlin, writing Kotlin from scratc

                    The difference between good code or bad code often comes down to how you apply the established practices of the software development community. In Good Code, Bad Code you'll learn how to boost your productivity and effectiveness with code development insights normally only learned through careful mentorship and hundreds of code reviews.

                    Software development is a team sport. For an application to succeed, your code needs to be robust and easy for others to understand, maintain, and adapt. Whether you're working on an enterprise team, contributing to an open source project, or bootstrapping a startup, it pays to know the difference between good code and bad code.
                    
                    Good Code, Bad Code is a clear, practical introduction to writing code that's a snap to read, apply, and remember. With dozens of instantly-useful techniques, you'll find coding insights that normally take years of experience to master. In this fast-paced guide, Google software engineer Tom Long teaches you a host of rules to apply, along with advice on when to break them!                 </p>

                <p>
                    What's the right way to move existing applications to the cloud to better use its power while enabling new features? In App Modernization on Azure Succinctly, Lorenzo Barbieri will help you understand how to modernize existing apps without completely rewriting them. This ebook will guide you through moving your app to the cloud, refactoring, rearchitecting, and choosing which cloud services will improve your app and experience. Most of the concepts in this book are also valid for a complete rewrite of an app directly in the cloud, or new apps built directly in the cloud.                 </p>
